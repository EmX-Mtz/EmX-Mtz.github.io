Welcome to my homepage!

I am a PhD student in Computer Science at the Centro de Investigación en Computación (CIC) of the Instituto Politécnico Nacional (IPN). My research interests lie in Quantum Computing, particularly in quantum machine learning. I earned my MSc in Computing Science and Electronics from the Universidad Autónoma del Estado de Hidalgo, and prior to that, I obtained a degree in Physics. My academic research focuses on the applications of quantum computing techniques within unsupervised machine learning.
