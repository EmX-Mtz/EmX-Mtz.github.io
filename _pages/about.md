<br>

Welcome! I am a PhD student in Computer Science at the Centro de [Investigación en Computación (CIC)](https://www.cic.ipn.mx/) of the [Instituto Politécnico Nacional (IPN)](https://www.ipn.mx/). My research interests lie in Quantum Computing, particularly in quantum machine learning. 

I earned my MSc in Computing Science and Electronics from the [Universidad Autónoma del Estado de Hidalgo](https://www.uaeh.edu.mx/), and prior to that, I obtained a degree in Physics. 
My academic research focuses on the applications of quantum computing techniques within unsupervised machine learning.
